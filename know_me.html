            <p>I'm currently in my second year at Rizvi College of Engineering in Bandra, Mumbai, pursuing a Bachelor's in Engineering with a focus on AI and Data Science. My passion lies in both programming and designing, but my core interest centers around AI and machine learning, where I'm sharpening my skills with Python. Alongside, I'm delving into the realms of front-end and back-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I approach every challenge with enthusiasm and a hunger to learn, making me a fast learner in this dynamic field.</p>

            <p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I actively seek out opportunities to apply my knowledge in real-world projects. Whether it's collaborating with peers on hackathons or undertaking personal coding projects, I'm always eager to push the boundaries of what I know and discover innovative solutions. Outside of the classroom, I'm an avid gamer, which not only fuels my passion for technology but also provides valuable insights into user experience and interface design. I believe that a well-rounded skill set, coupled with a curious and adaptable mindset, is key to succeeding in the ever-evolving landscape of AI, data science, and technology as a whole.</p>
